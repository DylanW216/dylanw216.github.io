		<p>  I am currently going to UCONN in the Stamford branch majoring in Digital Media Design. I used to go to the University of Connecticut up north in Storrs, but swictched out because it had eventually cost too much money to stay. In the Summer I work at a day camp in Greenwich, Connecticut. </p>
